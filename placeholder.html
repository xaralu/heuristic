                                    <p> I was inspired by the deviantart user @celluleneuronale in the design of the central figure for this sculpture. The most prominent thing about the artists style is their linework, which is sketchy, almost elementary. I created my own piece using bits of wire, cardboard, printed cutouts, circuit boards that I took from an old radio, and discarded plastic. </p>

                                    <p>This series was a reflection on tech being inescable.

                                    <p>An exploration of contrasting audio and visual mediums. The sound was constructed of a series of clips, primarily voicemail messages, of my family members who had tried to call me. The video is of the enviornment I was in, playing the pre recorded audio out loud. <br> I chose to film on the bridge because it symbolizes travel and transformation, and through my life I've moved a lot, and been unsure. I think by being on my own so much and confonted with the reality of who I am, people outside of me became valuable as sources of inspiration for myself, what I should be. So my messages from loved ones hit me hard, as when I listen back on this peice, I hear my identity reflected back from them, but also feel secure in their love for me even while I'm gone. </p>

                                    <p>Moomoo Saves Him is a simple, singleplayer game built for desktop. The player enters the game as the main character Moomoo, and explores the structures surrounding her. As the player progresses, the comic panels scattered throughout the game gradually come to together to form Moomoo's narrative.</p>
                                    <p>I fully tapped into this idea when I called my boyfriend on a vacation in France with my parents. I had felt super distant from him from the past couple weeks, I was so far away from him that I was scared that I wouldnt be able to make him understand my emotions and how I felt as a person in the moment. I wound up telling him my rough ideas for this game. Everything I told him came out so rushed and taught that I realized that all the plot points I'd planned correlated with pain I was feeling now with my parents, as well as the struggles living abroad (in France) when I was just a kid.</p>
                                    <p>I plan on finishing this game August 2024. </p>
